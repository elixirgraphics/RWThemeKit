###%user_styles%Outputs the users custom CSS into the head of the users page.

###%user_javascript%Outputs the users custom javascript code into the head of the users page.

#Colourtags

###%colour...%eg. %colour_header_background%This will be replaced by a colour specified in the theme.plist. This should be placed in an external style sheet. The style sheet should be included in the RWColourTagCSSFiles array in the theme.plist. There is no restriction on how many colour tags you can use. You may also use the same tag multiple times.
